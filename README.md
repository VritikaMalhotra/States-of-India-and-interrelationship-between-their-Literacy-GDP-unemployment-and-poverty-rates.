# States-of-India-and-interrelationship-between-their-Literacy-GDP-unemployment-and-poverty-rates.
How parameters such as Literacy rate, poverty, unemployment, GDP are related to each other for different Indian states and what do they tell about each state(e.g. living standards, is it more inclined towards farming or office jobs etc.)


The visualization was concerned with answering the question about how different parameters such as Literacy, GDP, Unemployment, Poverty are inter connected with each other. It can be clearly seen for different states that the states with a higher literacy rate has lower percentage of people below poverty line(Kerala has highest Literacy rate and lowest BPL percentage). Along with this higher literacy rate also depicts higher standard of living which can be depicted by GDP i.e. states with higher literacy have higher GDP.
We can also see that though some states have high Literacy rate(almost 80%) but large urban mass is unemployed(almost 60%) but as they have fairly high GDP it clearly states that people have other professions such as farming etc.

For states like Bihar we can see that they have low literacy rate, large mass is unemployed and they also have average GDP rates whereas for states like Tamil Nadu we can see they very high literacy rate, high GDP, very less BPL rates and lesser unemployment.

All this data and visualizations clearly state that India is still a developing country where some states are highly developed while some are still upon the path of developing.


My data and my visualizations have incorporated all of the 4 Cairo's principle's.

My design choices and data is truthful as I have taken all of the data from trusted sites (Wikipedia) and have not tampered it before plotting it. All the visualizations use true data acc. to Indian Gov.

I have kept in mind the concept of beauty and have used colors which are not too bright and not too dull and have also placed the legend such that it does not intersect with the bars.

I have kept in mind the concept of functionality. Have provided legends, appropriate title, X label, Y label. I have also provided hover interactivity where when the mouse pointer is on the top of the bar, it displays y axis value in a box which makes the visualization user friendly as well. I have used Bar plot as it the best option to depict all 4 parameter's clearly for each state.

The data which i have used and the visualization are extremely insightful as they give us the knowledge about states of India, their GDP, Literacy, Unemployment, Poverty and also show the relationship amongst these parameters.
